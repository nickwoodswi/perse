              Perse
            </b>
             is an easy-to-use workout record and builder for coaches, athletes, and personal trainers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Previously built workouts are stored in the Perse database for quick assignment. Select one, and assign it to an athlete on a single date, a range of dates, or on recurring dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying something new or leveling up? Build a new workout by selecting and adding exercises from those already added to the database. Or, name and add your own exercise before setting intensity by weight, distance, speed, tempo, and/or rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Review the programs you've set by viewing workouts assigned to any athlete in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perse was originally built with ReactJS for Mike Woods, a former Olympic speedskater and current youth speedskating coach for U.S. Speedskating.
