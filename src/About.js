                <p>Previously built workouts are stored in the Perse database for quick assignment. Select one, and assign it to an athlete on a single date, a range of dates, or on recurring dates.</p>

                <p>Trying something new or leveling up? Build a new workout by selecting and adding exercises from those already added to the database. Or, name and add your own exercise before setting intensity by weight, distance, speed, tempo, and/or rest.</p>

                <p>Review the programs you've set by viewing workouts assigned to any athlete in the system.</p>

                <p>Perse was originally built with ReactJS for Mike Woods, a former Olympic speedskater and current youth speedskating coach for U.S. Speedskating.</p>
